# Climate Change Analysis: Temperature Trends in the U.S.

## **Project Overview**
This project examines annual temperature trends in the U.S. over the past century, their impacts on economic sectors, and predicts future trends using machine learning. It integrates GIS mapping for visualization, cryptography for data protection, and an interactive Streamlit application for results.

---

## **Objectives**
- Analyze historical temperature trends in the U.S.
- Assess impacts on key economic sectors.
- Predict temperature trends for the next 7 years.
- Visualize regional temperature changes using GIS.
- Ensure data security through cryptography.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Analysis**: Preprocessed and analyzed historical data to uncover trends.
2. **Machine Learning**: Identified Random Forest as the best-performing model for temperature prediction.
3. **GIS Mapping**: Created a choropleth map for temperature changes in New York State.
4. **Data Protection**: Applied cryptography to secure sensitive data.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Built a Streamlit app to present findings and predictions.
